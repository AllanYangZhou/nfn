# Neural Functional Networks (NFNs)

This provides PyTorch layers for implementing **neural functional networks** (NFNs), as described in [Permutation Equivariant Neural Functional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14040). NFNs are equivariant deep learning architectures for processing weight space features, such as the weights or gradients of another neural network.
